## Data Format Support

ArgillaLabeler accepts any valid JSON/JSONL structure. Here are some example formats that can be handled:
> **Note**: While the tool accepts any JSON structure, it expects the data to be wrapped in a "data" array at the root level. The tool will automatically handle this conversion if needed.

### Simple Flat Structure
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "text": "Sample text",
      "category": "A"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complex Nested Structure
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "document": {
        "content": {
          "title": "Example",
          "paragraphs": [
            {"text": "First paragraph"},
            {"text": "Second paragraph"}
          ]
        },
        "metadata": {
          "author": {
            "name": "John",
            "id": 123
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The tool provides an interactive tree-view interface that allows you to:
- Navigate and select fields from any nested level
- Separate display fields from metadata
- Handle arrays and nested objects
- Process any valid JSON structure

## Example Data Formats

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "This product is amazing!",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "amazon",
        "category": "electronics"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "text": "The quality could be better",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "reviews",
        "category": "clothing"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSONL Format
```jsonl
{"id": "1", "text": "This product is amazing!", "metadata": {"source": "amazon", "category": "electronics"}}
{"id": "2", "text": "The quality could be better", "metadata": {"source": "reviews", "category": "clothing"}}
```

### Nested Data Example
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "document": {
        "id": "1",
        "content": {
          "title": "Product Review",
          "body": "Great product, highly recommended!",
          "ratings": {
            "quality": 5,
            "price": 4
          }
        },
        "user": {
          "id": "user123",
          "country": "US"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
